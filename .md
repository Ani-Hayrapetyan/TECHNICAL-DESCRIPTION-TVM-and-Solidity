### 1. About the Document

This document provides an overview of the TVM-adapted version of the Solidity programming language. It highlights the technical differences from standard Solidity, the changes made in the TVM version, and the new features it offers.



### 2. Purpose

The goal of this document is to help developers who are already familiar with Solidity quickly understand how these changes affect smart contract development on the TVM platform, what new possibilities they offer, and what limitations they should be aware of.



### 3. Target Audience

The intended audience for this document includes software developers, blockchain engineers, and technical architects who have experience with Solidity and are interested in deploying smart contracts on TVM. It is designed to be a practical guide, highlighting not only the differences but also the best practices for writing, testing, and optimizing contracts in this environment. By providing clear explanations, examples, and recommendations, this document aims to accelerate the learning curve and facilitate a smooth transition from standard Solidity to TVM-based development.



### 4. General Description of the Solidity System

Solidity is an object-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts. Smart contracts are programs that govern the behavior of accounts within the Ethereum state. It provides a high-level abstraction while giving precise control over storage, execution, and transaction flow.

Key characteristics of the Solidity system include:

- **Contract-Oriented Architecture:** Smart contracts serve as self-contained units encapsulating state variables, functions, and events. This modular design enables code reuse and logical separation of responsibilities.

- **Static Typing and Safety:** Solidity enforces type checking at compile-time, minimizing runtime errors and improving code reliability.

- **Inheritance and Interfaces:** The language supports multiple inheritance and interface definitions, allowing developers to build modular, extendable, and interoperable contract systems.

- **Event Logging:** Contracts can emit events that external applications can subscribe to, enabling monitoring, notifications, and integration with off-chain services.

- **Rich Standard Library:** Built-in types _(uint, int, bool, address, bytes, string)_, mappings, arrays, and structures simplify contract logic. Cryptographic primitives and utility functions support secure contract development.

- **Execution Environment:** Solidity contracts compile to Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) bytecode, ensuring deterministic execution and gas-based resource management for predictable network performance and security.

Solidity’s design balances high-level abstraction with low-level control. It allows developers to implement a wide range of decentralized applications, including token contracts, decentralized finance protocols, games, and other blockchain-based systems. Its combination of modular structure, strong typing, and explicit control over execution makes it the primary choice for Ethereum smart contract development.

### 5. General Description of the TVM

The **TON Virtual Machine (TVM)** is a specialized virtual machine designed to execute smart contracts on the **TON/Everscale** blockchain platform. Unlike the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), TVM is built around an **asynchronous message-passing model** and a **cell-based data structure**, which allows efficient storage, retrieval, and execution of decentralized programs.

Key characteristics of the TVM include:

- **Asynchronous Execution:** Each transaction corresponds to the processing of a single incoming message. Contracts cannot perform synchronous calls; all interactions occur through messages that are processed independently, ensuring scalability and resilience.

- **Cell-Based Storage:** TVM uses a hierarchical, tree-like structure of cells to store contract state and messages. This structure enables compact, efficient serialization and supports advanced operations like partial updates and proofs.

- **Gas and Resource Management:** TVM employs a gas-based execution model, allowing fine-grained control over computational and storage resources while preventing network abuse. Built-in instructions provide developers with tools to manage gas dynamically.

- **Low-Level Data Primitives:** TVM supports specialized types such as `cell`, `slice`, and `builder`, providing powerful mechanisms for data manipulation and contract optimization.

- **Extended ABI and Message Handling:** TVM contracts use a flexible ABI (Application Binary Interface) and can handle complex message formats, including internal and external messages, with optional flags controlling message behavior.

- **Security and Determinism:** The deterministic nature of TVM execution ensures predictable outcomes, while its model isolates contract execution, reducing attack surfaces and enhancing security.

The TVM is specifically optimized for high-throughput, decentralized applications on the TON/Everscale network. Its design allows developers to implement scalable, secure, and modular smart contracts while taking advantage of unique TVM features that differ from traditional EVM-based environments.
